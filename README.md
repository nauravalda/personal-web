## Personal Blog Website

Hi, this is my holiday projects. 
I made a personal blog website only using html and css. I still dont know how to deal with php and js yetðŸ˜­, so i will probably make some commits here once i learn php and js.

## How to display the website
Follow this link https://naura-personalweb.netlify.app. If it cracked or smth you can clone this repo and simply open the home.html file (on html directory).
